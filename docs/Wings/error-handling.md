## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Solutions

#### 401 Unauthorized
1. Check if Authorization header is present
2. Verify token format: `Bearer TOKEN`
3. Ensure token is valid and not expired
4. Check token permissions

#### 404 Not Found
1. Verify resource exists
2. Check server UUID is correct
3. Ensure file path is valid
4. Verify backup UUID is correct

#### 409 Conflict
1. Check server state before operation
2. Wait for current operation to complete
3. Cancel conflicting operations first

#### 422 Unprocessable Entity
1. Validate request payload
2. Check required fields are present
3. Verify field formats and values
4. Review API documentation

#### 500 Internal Server Error
1. Check Wings logs for details
2. Verify system resources
3. Check Docker availability
4. Review configuration

### Log Analysis

#### Check Wings Logs
```bash
# View recent errors
tail -f /var/log/wings/daemon.log | grep -i error

# Search for specific request ID
grep "request-id" /var/log/wings/daemon.log

# Check authentication errors
grep -i "auth\|token" /var/log/wings/daemon.log
```

#### Check System Resources
```bash
# Check disk space
df -h

# Check memory usage
free -h

# Check Docker status
docker info
```

## üìû Support

When reporting errors, include:
1. **Request ID** from the error response
2. **Full error message** and status code
3. **Request details** (endpoint, payload, headers)
4. **Wings logs** around the time of the error
5. **System information** (OS, Wings version, Docker version)
