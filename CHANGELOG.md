# Changelog

## v0.0.3-Canary

### Added

- Complete redesign of the admin dashboard with a modular widget system
- Versioning system for featherpanel!
- Added a dark logo option for support for fully white mode and dark mode!

### Improved

- Improved file upload inside Docker containers: increased maximum upload size, enhanced reliability, and optimized the file upload service for better performance.
- File editor has received a complete design overhaul for a more modern and user-friendly experience.
- File manager has received a full redesign for improved usability and modern appearance.
- Major design overhaul and improved user experience for the following server management pages: **Backups**, **Databases**, **Schedules**, **Tasks**, and **Subusers**. Each page now features a modernized interface, enhanced empty states, and more intuitive workflows.
- Recreated the entire server console UI using a new console library, resulting in a significantly improved design and much better performance for the server console.

### Fixed

- Added a new private replacePlaceholders() method to both controllers to centralize and standardize placeholder replacement logic.
- Modern placeholders (e.g., {{server.build.default.port}}, {{server.build.default.ip}}, {{server.build.memory}}) are now automatically replaced with actual server values.
- Legacy placeholders (e.g., {{server.build.env.SERVER_PORT}}, {{env.SERVER_PORT}}, {{server.build.env.SERVER_IP}}, {{env.SERVER_IP}}, {{server.build.env.SERVER_MEMORY}}, {{env.SERVER_MEMORY}}) are also replaced with the correct values for compatibility.
- Legacy Docker interface placeholder {{config.docker.interface}} is now converted to {{config.docker.network.interface}} and passed through for Wings to handle, matching Pterodactyl's behavior.
- Replaced remaining instances of "Pterodactyl Wings" branding in the panel with FeatherPanel terminology
- Fixed an issue where renaming files or folders could trigger PHP warnings about undefined array keys "path" and "new_name" in ServerFilesController.php.
- Fixed an issue where creating an archive could result in thousands of unnecessary archives being created instead of a single one.
