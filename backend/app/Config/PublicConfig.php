     * ⚠️ DANGER ZONE - HANDLE WITH EXTREME CAUTION ⚠️.
     *
     * This is a critical configuration section that defines default values for public settings.
     * Any changes made here will affect the entire application's behavior.
     *
     * IMPORTANT SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
     * - This is the ONLY place where default values should be modified
     * - All values defined here are PUBLIC and accessible from the frontend
     * - These values are visible to ALL users of the application
     * - The data is also collected and sent to telemetry services
     *
     * NEVER add sensitive information such as:
     * - API keys or tokens
     * - Passwords or credentials
     * - Private configuration values
     * - Internal system details
     *
     * Any sensitive data added here will be exposed publicly and could lead to
     * security vulnerabilities. Always use proper secure storage for sensitive values.
